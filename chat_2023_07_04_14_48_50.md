To convert these colors to CSS variables, you can follow these steps:

1. Open your CSS file or create a new one.
2. Define each color as a CSS variable using the `--` prefix followed by a name of your choice. For example:

```css
:root {
  --white: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
  --light-gray: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
  --grayish-blue: hsl(220, 15%, 55%);
  --dark-blue: hsl(218, 44%, 22%);
}
```

3. Once you have defined the variables, you can use them throughout your CSS file. For example, to set the background color of an element to white, you can use the `var()` function and reference the `--white` variable:

```css
body {
  background-color: var(--white);
}
```

This will set the background color of the `body` element to the value of the `--white` variable, which is `hsl(0, 0%, 100%)`.

By using CSS variables, you can easily change the color values in one place (the variable declaration) and have the changes propagate to all the places where the variables are used. It provides a centralized and flexible way to manage and update colors in your CSS code.
